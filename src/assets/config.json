        "about": "How does recent renaming of streets and the use of the exogenous language English in Rwanda affects citizens who move and navigate in the urban space? Naming practices reflect socio-political conditions and can be seen as a manifestation of authority and ideology. This project contributes to a new way of studying political change and power relations in Rwanda. It stresses the role of language in social development, especially in relation to identity and social cohesion."
